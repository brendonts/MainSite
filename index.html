                            During my later time working at Sodexo USA (Mason Dining) I took over management of all of our technology operations. I took this opportunity to implement several industry standard practices including a help desk ticketing system to better manage user requests and problems. This among other improvements greatly increased user/customer satisfaction. This system I put in place was easily transferable to new employees as well.

                        <p>
                            One of the biggest challenges at my current org. was properly and effeciantly handing how accounts are created, deleted, and permission are handled. Previously it was being handled by a costly workflow application that had many limitations and security concerns. After doing some research, I implemented Microsoft's workflow product: Azure Logic Apps to completly automate account creation and licensing, deletion, among other tasks. I accomplished this using Microsot Graph API which allowed us to do so much more than we previously could. This new system used existing resources and new ones costing no more than pennies per month. The end result saving time, money, and greaty increasing the security on our organization. Moving forward, I have begun expanding my knowledge of working with APIs to make further systems or information accessable.
